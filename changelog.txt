The old custom head textures are no longer supported by the server.
Therefore, you need to change any custom heads in your GUI and entities.yml files to the new
skin URLs.

Here, you can find more information on how to do that: https://github.com/Angeschossen/PluginFrameworkAPI/wiki/New-Head-Textures
If you want to use the new default custom player heads:
The default GUI custom heads can be found here: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/blob/master/definitions_gui.yml
The default role custom heads can be found here: https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/blob/master/roles.yml
If you don't do this, you'll receive lots of spam from the server in your console log.
