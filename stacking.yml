  # Should spawned entities be stacked?

    # 0 means unlimited
    max-size: 500

  # Should stacked entities receive knockback when they get hit?
  knockback: true

  # Should spawned entities be able to move on their own?
  # If set to false, these entities will not move, but will still be pushed by water etc.
  # This helps to improve server performance.
  remove-ai:
    enabled: false
    # Should entities without AI be able to be pushed around? This also affects knockback when hitting a stacked entity.
    # Besides that, entities won't fall if spawned in the AIR, if this option is disabled.
    pushing: true
    # Here you can add entity types that should keep AI.
